                <p class="about-text-p">I am a language enthusiast and I thoroughly enjoy the study of linguistics and literature. However, I recently decided to challenge myself and explore other languages that are out of the norm for me, such as, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have been attending the coding bootcamp with The University of Birmingham for a month now and I have completed an introduction to three different languages. I am enjoying the course thus far and I look forward to see how I progress as the course goes on.</p>
